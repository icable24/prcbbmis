## 1.2 

After doing some research on windows 10 i found one limitation. Windows does not allow the default configured 0.0.0.0 as a valid host to connect to. This update will update the default code to host on localhost (127.0.0.1) and connect to localhost as well.

- CHAT_SERVER_IP is now deprecated as from now we will use a more generic name like CHAT_SERVER_HOST.

## 1.1

In this release i have added private chat!

## 1.0

This is the first stable release of mysql_websocket_chat. This project features basic websocket chat with configurable database setup to log chat message.
